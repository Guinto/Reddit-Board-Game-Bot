# Reddit-Board-Game-Bot
This fetches board game entries from the 5 Color Combo board game API whenever a comment is made and replies with the listed boardgame. It's running on a free heroku tier currently. 

## How to use it
The bot only checks comments on the /r/boardgames subreddit right now. If you make a post using the syntax ```[[exact game name]]``` then it will reply with an image of the game and a link to the game's listing on the 5 Color Combo board game search. Here's a link to a real example.
